config RK_FB_FIXED_SCALING
	bool "Force screen centered LCDC scaling"
	depends on FB_ROCKCHIP
	help
	This option forces a resized LCDC layer (window) to be placed in the
	center of the screen. Removes a lot of the flexility of the hardware
	which allows almost arbitrary placement and scaling of a layer. It
	might have been used for the Android feature which allows scaling
	down of the active output relative to the screen. Disable for hardware
	accelerated XV support in xf86-video-fbturbo.
	
config RK_FB_DEFAULT_32BPP
	bool "Default to 32 bit color depth"
	depends on FB_ROCKCHIP
	help
	Sets the framebuffer to 32 bit BGRA color mode. If disabled, fallback
	to the old color depth setting: either 16 bit (RGB565) if
	CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_BMP is disabled, or 32 bit RGBA if enabled. Warning:
	the configuration for using 32 bit RGBA seems to be incomplete.
	Only enable if your machine has at least a 32 bit wide memory interface;
	this is known to cause significant performance degradation on machines
	with a 16 bit memory interface. This does not affect video displayed
	using the hardware accelerated XV driver.	

config EDID_BASICTOSVD_GEN2THOMAS_FIX
	bool     "EDID fix by gen2thomas to make all resolutions available"
  help
   This fix ensure that all resolutions from basic EDID block of your display 
   are also available for your device. In case the extended EDID block of your 
   display has some SVD's (short video descriptor) the basic EDID block 
   informations will be lost without this fix.
   
   Background: Some monitors EDID (f.e. acer P225HQL) have no duplicated entry in basic and
   extended block. F.e. the 1920x1080p resolution is only described in the basic EDID block 
   and some other resolutions are available as SVD of the extended EDID block.
   Therefore the 1920x1080p resolution (or possible others) will be lost although the monitor
   would support it.
   
config EDID_FINDBESTMODE_GEN2THOMAS_FIX
	bool     "EDID fix by gen2thomas to find best mode also for not sorted lists"
  help
   This patch get the best mode from the given list also in the case that the list is not sorted 
   correctly and also for the case that the highest resolution not match the given ratio of the
   screen. In that case the best resolution for the matching ratio to the screen is used. Also 
   for two equivalent resolutions the mode with the higher frequency is found and used. 
   
   Background: The original method only differentiate between two cases. But the real world know
   nine cases (three for x, three for y and the combinations). The patched algorithm know and match 
   all nine cases.
